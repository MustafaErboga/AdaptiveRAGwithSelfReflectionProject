# Adaptive RAG Framework with Self-Reflection

This project introduces an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that **dynamically adapts** its strategy based on query relevance and integrates **self-reflection** to enhance response quality.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features

- **Dynamic Query Analysis:**  
  Analyze incoming questions to route them adaptively based on their relation to the indexed knowledge.

- **Multi-Path Reasoning:**  
  Switch between retrieval, re-querying, and web search depending on the context and available information.

- **Self-Reflection:**  
  After generating an initial answer, the system evaluates its own outputs for relevance, completeness, and hallucinations.

- **Question Rewriting:**  
  If retrieved documents are insufficient, the system can automatically reformulate the question for better retrieval outcomes.

- **Optional Expansions:**  
  Framework design allows plugging in additional nodes (e.g., API queries, external databases) easily.

## âš¡ How It Works

1. **Query Analysis:**  
   The system determines if the query is related to the available index.  
   - Related â†’ RAG pathway  
   - Unrelated â†’ Web Search pathway

2. **Retrieval and Grading:**  
   Retrieved documents are graded for relevance before generation.

3. **Self-Reflection Loop:**  
   After generation, outputs are checked for:
   - **Relevance**
   - **Completeness**
   - **Absence of hallucinations**

4. **Adaptive Rewriting:**  
   If the answer is insufficient, the system rewrites the question and retries the retrieval process.

5. **Multi-Source Answering:**  
   If index retrieval fails, optional web search is triggered to find the best possible answer.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Minimize hallucinations and irrelevant outputs in RAG systems
- Maximize query handling flexibility
- Improve user trust by providing self-validated answers
- Provide a modular blueprint for scalable AI systems

## ðŸ“š Future Work

- Add more adaptive routes (e.g., specialized domain APIs)
- Fine-tune grading and reflection modules with Reinforcement Learning
- Benchmark performance against vanilla RAG systems
